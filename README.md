Thanks to Kitt, who has written the plot of the story and some of the original code. While I optimised the code and added a few features.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) *(Recommended Python 3.7.4 at time of writing)*
2. During installation, make sure that Python is added to your PATH variables
3. After installation, install **Pyglet 1.3.2** using this command in your terminal: ```pip install pyglet==1.3.2```
4. Download the latest version of this project [here](https://github.com/cchunzhe/PrisonEscapeHorror/archive/master.zip)
5. Extract the zip file and you are good to go

## Run Instructions

1. Open a terminal in the project root folder
2. Run this command: ```python3 game.py```
    * If you are running Windows 10 Update 1903, use ```py game.py``` because Microsoft reserved ```python3``` for the Microsoft Store version
